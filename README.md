# 🛠 Tools & Technologies Used

- **SQL** – KPI calculation and data analysis

- **Power BI** – Data transformation, modeling, and dashboard visualization

- **Power Query & DAX** – Feature engineering and performance metrics

## 🧮 SQL KPIs 
- Total & Average Sales *(Overall Business Health) (Helps benchmark current performance before targeting 15–20% growth)*
- Total Boxes Shipped *(Shows operational scale and demand volume)*

# 🔄 Data Transformation (Power BI)

**To support advanced analysis, the following transformations were performed:**

Data type standardization (Date, Amount, Boxes Shipped)
Feature engineering:
- Month Name
- Month Number (for correct sorting)
- Quarter
Creation of calculated measures:
- Sales per Box
- Average Sale per Transaction

*All transformations were completed before building visuals to ensure a stable data model.*
